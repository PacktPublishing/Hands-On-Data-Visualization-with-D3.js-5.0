# Hands-On Data Visualization with D3.js 5.0 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Data Visualization with D3.js 5.0 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/hands-data-visualization-d3js-50-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789340594), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The student will create stunning data visualizations using D3.js v5 and SVG. This course will teach students about scales by converting data into visuals to work on any browser or device.
I have included examples with multiple transitions & animations in graphs to make them more interesting & appealing to the users. This course will also guide students to build interactive bar charts, scatter plots and force layouts by manipulating big amounts of data. We will also create choropleth maps and layouts to display visual patterns on geographical locations.
By the end of this course, students will have learned how to visualize data and code more effectively. Students will build their own data models with D3.js that are much faster & with ease.
